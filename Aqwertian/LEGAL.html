<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p3">Aqwertyan Music Systems, Inc.  (AMS)  <i>Music at Your Fingertips!</i> application is a midi format music player and performance capability for personal enjoyment on the Apple  iPad.</p>
<p class="p3"><i>Music at Your Fingertips!</i>  facilitates the import of midi files  via iTunes,  of midi music files located on a customer’s PC,  and from internet music sites that offer midi files  for sale and for  free.   AMS does not track, does not want to track, and has no way of tracking, customer music choices or sources.   </p>
<p class="p3"><i>Music at your Fingertips!</i>  is not a notation or composition application.  Imported midi files are neither altered nor produced by <i>Music at Your Fingertips!</i>  AMS does not sell music in any form.   All music purchase transactions, if any, are handled independent of <i>Music at Your Fingertips!  </i></p>
<p class="p3">It is AMS, Inc.’s. focus and fondest dream is that <i>Music at Your Fingertips!’ </i>performance capability  will prove to be very synergistic with Music Industry growth goals, especially those of encouraging new music performers in all walks of life.  For instance like   Karaoke by enabling millions of hitherto music performance disenfranchised people throughout the world to enjoy music in a new way the Music Industry supply chain from performing artist to ultimate consumer has benefited.   That is a very good thing!    After all...Music is the “Universal Language of Mankind” and now  ‘At Last...Everyone can Play!’  and the world will undoubtedly be a  happier and more friendly place!  </p>
