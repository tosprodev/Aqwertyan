<p class="p1"><b>Adjusting Performance Difficulty</b></p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p3">Some MIDI songs are much more difficult to play than others, so Aqwertyan provides multiple ways to adjust the difficulty of a song. To configure a song, head to the Arrangement screen. There, you will find three buttons in the upper left corner, which control difficulty options.</p>
<p class="p4"><br></p>
<p class="p3"><b>Exact Match</b> (the first button) controls whether or not each note is mapped to a specific letter key. If you turn this off, any key you tap will play the correct note. If a song is complex or fast, turning off Exact Match can make it much easier to play.</p>
<p class="p4"><br></p>
<p class="p3"><b>Chording</b> (the second button) will combine all notes of a chord into a single note when turned on. This means that you won't have to worry about hitting multiple keys at the same time.</p>
<p class="p4"><span class="Apple-tab-span">	</span></p>
<p class="p3"><b>Piano Keys </b>(the third button) will turn the performance keyboard into an 8-key piano style keyboard.<span class="Apple-converted-space">Â </span></p>
<p class="p4"><br></p>
<p class="p3">Finally, you can change your role in the song by picking a different channel to perform. To select a channel on the Arrangement screen, tap the "Solo" button under that channel. Picking the right channel is crucial for an enjoyable performance! We recommend trying to pick the channel that is carrying the melody. You can do this by watching the note animations, or by muting channels until you determine which one is playing the instrument you are interested in. Remember to un-mute any channels when you are done, or they will remain muted for the performance.</p>
<p class="p4"><br></p>
<p class="p3">When you are first starting, you may find it most enjoyable to make the songs as easy as possible by turning off Exact Match, and turning on Chording and Piano Keys. As you get better, or desire more of a challenge, using Exact Match and the qwerty keyboard will give you a more realistic performance feel.</p>
